## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source code):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Employee Management System"
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Since this project uses MySQL, you will need the MySQL database connector. Install Django and the mysqlclient:
   ```bash
   pip install django mysqlclient
   ```

4. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running.
   - Create a new MySQL database named `employee_management_sys`:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE employee_management_sys;
     ```
   - Use your MySQL username or password, update the `DATABASES` configuration in `backend/settings.py` to match your local MySQL setup.

5. **Run Migrations:**
   Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables.
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser (Admin account):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password.

7. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You will be redirected to the login page where you can log in using the superuser account you just created.
